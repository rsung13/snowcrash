Inspecting the binary and the token file which contains some imprintable characters, we see that the program returns a modified string with certain logics

With a couple of tries we discover that the 'encryption' logic is to add 'i' offset to the original [i]th character.

So we write a mini c program which 'decrypts' this modified string substracting 'i' offsets from the [i]th characters.

The token file was actually a result of the level09 binary,
so we run a.out $(cat token)

the flag is: f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
